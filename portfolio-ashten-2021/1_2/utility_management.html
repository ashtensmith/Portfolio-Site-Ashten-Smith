          <h2>The Problem</h2>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="container">Diagnosis: AppFolio Utility Management is a blackbox experience for users. This has led to an erosion of trust, an increase in customer success cases and has blocked property managers from being able to address errors and resolve resident questions.</p>
      <p class="container">Challenge: The team needs to find a way to improve product transparency by giving a satisfactory explanations for how resident charges are calculated. </p>
      <p class="container">Timeframe: This is the team’s primary focus for H2 2021 The team is empowered to determine the scope of the solution, but should be prioritizing an agile mindset.</p>

          <h2>The Process</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Research</h3>
          <p>The first necessary step was to collect all secondary research completed from previous teams and market validation efforts. Then, I went to customer service cases submitted over the last 90 days and manually tagged those based on where
            in the user workflow painpoints were surfacing. I then created a path in Pendo to determine where the user was going after they visited the initial workflow in question. The image seen is from the Pendo reports and shows that after
            viewing the utility management page, users were often going to the tenant's pages to gather more information to determine the validity and accuracy of charges. A hypothesis began to form within the team that users were needing both occupancy
            information and their lease information. Eliminating the need to go on this treasure hunt emerged as a clear painpoint. I shared my findings with the rest of utility management leadership and was able to convice them that efficiency metrics also
            needed to become part of the conversation when framing this problem to the team. Not only did we need to reveal more data, we needed to aim to make the data we already share more convenient to access and leverage.</p>

          <h3>Diverge & Converge</h3>
          <p>I then facilitated a design studio for the team to align on the state of the product and it's problem, help determine and define success, and from there, generate some ideas for solutions we could explore. Each member got a chance to
            present and then the team could critique. We then did a prioritization exercise to determine what pieces of each solution we thought was most important to validate. We landed on pursuing the ideas that a property manager most likely
            needed to know the billback formula applied for a property, relevant lease dates and general unit data (square footage, total number of occuoants, etc.).</p>

        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Iterate</h3>
          <p>Based on the designs presented I put together some mockups that represented the team’s ideas in a format that was more design system-friendly. I also laid out some of the various scenarios to represent that different designs supported
            varying levels of granularity and detail. After some more critiquing and domain knowledge sharing, it became clear that these approaches, while low effort, would not likely satisfy the problem in a way that is noticeably efficient or
            effective.

        <p>The next day, I came in with a different design based on that feedback. This design applied the feedback that the devs initially had about wanting to continue to build in utility-app and adding a tertiary level to utility management gave
          us more screen real estate to work with. The team felt good about showing that to a customer to see if it met their expectations.</p>

          <h3>Validatation Approach</h3>
          <p>I recruited some customers based on very specific criteria. Each customer was a domain expert and current user, but their roles regarding utility billing were all different, and the scenarios for which they needed an explanation of
            charges was also different. I wanted to see what pieces of the design they all agreed on.
            In general, the basic skeleton, the navigation and high level details all had high agreement, so the PM and I felt confident about starting to build out the larger part of the design while we ironed out and iterated on the other parts of
            the solution we felt necessary for the second release. The mockup here illustrates all of the new content tested but does not indicate the pieces with highest agreement. </p>
        </div>
        <div>

            <img src="img/validationapproach_2.png" alt="Mockup 4">
          </picture>
        </div>
        <p> One design challenge I was aware of going into prototype testing was that the existing product doesn't have a formalized system for naming trasactions.
          For bills in particular, this becomes important so that users can detect when a bill may have been accidentally entered twice.
          For this part of the prototype, I chose remain open to the possibility of performing a variant of rite testing so that the team could learn quickly
          what the best approach would be to express a utility bill tied to a charge. My first approach was to indicate that a bill was linked to a charge by showing the bill
          reference number as a way to differentiate them. That approach solicited a great deal of questions and hesitation. I quickly learned that my first guess was totally wrong and did not resonate with users in any role.
          Even using the word label "utility bill" was confusing because it could technically be referring to the resident's bill. The
          next approach was more explicit and a step in the right direction, but we as a team felt that we could add even more value. We then showed a third approach.
          With the third approach, customers not only understood that a "related bill" was the utility bill for the property, they appreciated seeing the final bill amounts right away and expressed that in
          some using the link to navigate to the entire bill wouldn't even be necessary. Being able to just look at the total bill amount and the calculated resident charge would be enough to at a
          glance determine if the charge was fair and correctly calculated.

          <h3>Post Production</h3>
          <p> For our first release, we added an in-app announcement in addition to a feedback button which allowed the user submit a likert scale response and a free form response to indicate satisfaction. I tagged the feedback and reported any
            emerging themes.</p>
